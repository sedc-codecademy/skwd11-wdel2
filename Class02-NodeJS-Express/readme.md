# Express Framework

## Introduction

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is designed for building web applications and APIs quickly and efficiently with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Routing**: Express provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes to handle HTTP requests.

- **Middleware**: It allows you to execute functions during the request-response cycle. This enables tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

- **Templating Engines**: While Express does not have a built-in templating engine, it supports various popular engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars.

- **Error Handling**: It has built-in error handling middleware that can catch errors and pass them along to the error handling functions.

- **Static File Serving**: Express can serve static files like HTML, images, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Robust Routing**: Supports both basic and advanced routing with features like route parameters and query string handling.

## Installation

You can install Express using npm:

```bash
npm install express
```

## Getting Started

To create a basic Express application, create an `app.js` file and add the following:

```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```
